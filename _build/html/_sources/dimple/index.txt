  **Simply Powerful**

  The aim of dimple is to open up the power
  and flexibility of d3 to analysts. It aims
  to give a gentle learning curve and minimal
  code to achieve something productive. 
  It also exposes the d3 objects so you can
  pick them up and run to create some really cool stuff.
