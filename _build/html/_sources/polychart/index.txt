==========

`Polychart.js <https://github.com/Polychart/polychart2>`_ is a flexible javascript library for plotting interactive charts. It is based on the grammar of graphics. Here is a description taken verbatim from the Polychart Wiki. 

	Polychart.js is an expressive JavaScript graphing library capable of producing a wide array of graphics fairly easily. It takes care of many of the fiddly details that make plotting a hassle (like drawing legends) as well as providing a powerful model of graphics that makes it easy to produce complex multi-layered graphics. Additionally, it has a built-in interaction model that makes it easy to produce charts that interact with the user and with one another.
